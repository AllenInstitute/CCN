Description: To facilitate cross-dataset comparison, the Allen Institute created the CCN for matching and tracking cell types across studies.  A primary objective of the CCN was to develop a system that would be straightforward and allow designation of cell types with or without hierarchical organization. This library applies the CCN to any data set.  More details can be found here: https://portal.brain-map.org/explore/classes/nomenclature
